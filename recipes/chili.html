    <ul>
        <li>1 yellow onion. (medium to large)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 lb. protein of choice. (Ground Beef, Ground Turkey, Shredded Chicken, etc.)</li>
        <li>2 15oz. choice of canned beans. (Black, Kidney, Pinto, etc.)</li>
        <li>1 15oz. can of corn</li>
        <li>1 15oz. can diced tomatoes with juices</li>
        <li>1 6oz. can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 cup of water or broth of choice. (You can even mix 1/2 water 1/2 broth, etc.)</li>
        <li>chili powder, cumin, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne powder for desired amounts of seasoning</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown / cook the protein first if desired.</li>
        <li>Sautee onions next if desired in same pan to grab the leftover flavor from the protein.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, whether you did the first 2 steps or not, throw everything into the crockpot and I would advise to cook on low for several hours until desired consistency, temperature, and flavor.</li>
