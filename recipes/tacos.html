        The king of cheap and low effort, yet so healthy and delicious - Chili. 
        If you got ~$20 and a handy crockpot, look no further than this classic dish that will make you so full and warm. 
        Chili might as well be the pizza or salad of soups with how versatile and customizable it is, with the ability to make it never the same way.
        This is just one way to prepare this awesome dish!
